# Computation_In-Memory_With_Ferro
A project concerning novel logic design and non-volatile material under the supervision of Dr. Jiun-In Guo and Tien-Sheng Chao @ National Chiao Tung University.
Unfortunately, this project didn't go to the implementation part because of the pandamics. 
I have run through some verification by Hspice to the logic design, but some revisions are needed while scaling up.
